## Debuffs

### Explosions

Different explosions cause different effects to bosses, Most common explosions at GT!Frisk 7, GT!Chara HATE 1, Undyne True Hero 8/"Catch." Spear, literatly ever Undyne True Hero attack, anything that goes boom

Depending on the size/type of explosion, a different effect/debuff will occur to the enemy.  The weakest being anything besides the ones listed, and the most powerful being HATE 1.

### Stuns

Stuns occur on select bosses, mainly the final bosses.

Bosses that get stunned allow more damage to be dealt by having their defense set to -23 for 30-90 seconds.

## Buffs

### [+ ENRAGED]

Enraging a boss ranges from just being annoying to killing a member of their family to stealing things.

Causing a boss to be enraged gives them a major ATK and DEF buff. Once a boss is enraged, they can be reverted back.

### [+ OUTRAGED]

Outraging a boss only occurs when a boss has A: been ENRAGED and B: someone fighting the boss has been teasing them.

Causing a boss to be outraged gives them a MASSIVE. ATK and DEF buff, along with giving them more determination and restoring their HP. Once a boss is OUTRAGED, they can NOT be reverted back.

### [+ FURIOUS]

[+ FURIOUS]-ing a boss is nearly impossible, but can happen.  A boss has to A: be OUTRAGED, B: Be below 7000 HP, and C: Have little to no sanity left.

A boss that has been [+ FURIOUS]-ed will begin to have Soul Decay occur, however they will become insanely tanky and have their ATK multipled by 4.

It is IMPOSSIBLE to revert away from FURIOUS.

## Global Effects

### Sanity

Sanity is one of the few effects that apply to all characters.  When a characters sanity drops, they can begin to attack their own team or begin to "decay".

Sanity is able to be restored, although somewhat hard to do and is near impossible to restore once a soul has already begun to decay.

### Soul Decay

Soul Decay occurs when either a characters Sanity drops below safe levels, or when they begin pushing their powers too much.

Soul decay is nearly impossible to recover from as it completly drains all life and DETERMINATION from ones soul.
