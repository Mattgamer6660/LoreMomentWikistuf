## Battle Basics

While in a battle, players have multiple options on what they could do.  They can attempt to reason with the enemy (Which as of Series 3+ is ineffective during fights, and in Series 4 [+ ENRAGE]'s the target.), They can fight back, Run away/flee to avoid any further attacks or to avoid harming the enemy, Use a item such as a **Calling Card** or **Consumable**.

Certain actions can prevent bosses from attacking further, for instance if the players were in a fight against Kari (Donut's sister.) after they killed donut either on pupose or on accident, they could mention they know a way to bring their brother back.  This can be done in fights as well, and if done correctly will halt the fight completely.

Killing a enemy either on accident or on pupose can result in DT increasements, which will lower all involved party members **Pacifist** status' by the amount of DT gained, capping at 7 DT.

## DT and Status'

### DT/Determination

By default, certain party members will have more DT then others.  The longer a member has been in the party, the more they will have.  This also can relate to their current DT Stat, which is completely different.  A players DT Stat is a different name for their LV.

### Status'

By default, all party members are at a even amount of **"Route Status"**.  The **Route Status** determines what route a player is on by the highest percentage.  There are four routes in totally, each of them being: Pacifist, Neutral, Genocide, True Pacifist.  Routes can completely change the way a chapter goes.

#### Pacifist

Pacifist routes can be maintained by A: Killing no body and only attacking in self defense and B: Befriending most of the bosses/characters.  This will most likely occur more on players below 8 DT.

#### Neutral

Neutral routes can be gained from doing a mix of killing/sparing bosses.  You are able to befriend bosses. This is the most likely route for players between 8 and 16 DT.

#### Genocide

Genocide routes are done by killing all bosses in a chapter or killing off smaller enemys that dont count as true bosses.  A example being the child.  Between 17 and 22 DT are the most likely spots for a character to be in Genocide.

#### True Pacifist

True Pacifist may be the hardest route to pull off, having to be on 1 DT for the entire course of Lore Moment (Series 1-4).  You are not allowed to kill anyone, and you must befriend all bosses/characters to pull this off.  The prize is worth it.. maybe.
